# todo_list

## Overview

HTML5 page, coded with HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app bases on a training project by JetBrains Academy (https://hyperskill.org/).
I created all the code myself.

## Main features
- Show page with a simple todo list
- Save list and reload list to/from local storage
- Create and delete tasks
- Change display of tasks depending on checkbox state by CSS and/or JavaScript

## Use/Installation

To get the project running on your local machine, you may:
### Copy and run my code only
- My code stays in "To-Do List/task/src".
- Run "todo_list/To-Do List/task/src/index.html" in Browser.

### Copy and run JetBrains full training project
- Copy training project 
- Open it with JetBrains WebStorm.
- Run "To-Do List/task/src/index.html" in Browser.

- "todo_list/Topics/" contains additionally a couple of tiny solutions for training lessons. Ignore them.
